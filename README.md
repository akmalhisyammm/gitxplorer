# GitXplorer

Web application to explore GitHub organizations and their repositories with ease, integrated with [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

## Motivation

The motivation behind GitXplorer is to create a seamless and efficient way to explore GitHub organizations and their repositories. As developers, we often need to search for specific organizations, view their details, and open their repositories. Existing tools and interfaces can be cumbersome and slow. GitXplorer aims to streamline this process, making it faster and more intuitive to find GitHub organizations and their repositories.

## Features

- Quick search and filter of GitHub organizations and their repositories.
- Detailed view of organization and repository information.
- Configurable theme, it will respect the system's theme initially, but you can always change it.
- Utilization of Server Components and Client Components for maximum performance.
- Fully responsive and user-friendly interface with a modern design.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the React framework for the web
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as the component-based UI library
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as the CI/CD part of the application
